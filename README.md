# scripts

+developer 1 must be added to launch params otherwise these will not work


## get started

- download latest release from https://github.com/Mauler125/detours_r5
- copy files from detours_r5 into game root for the appropriate build
- download these scripts and copy them into `platform/scripts` so that you have folders such as `platform/scripts/vscripts`
- add `+developer 1` to the launch params (currently located in platform/cfg/startup_debug.cfg)
- launch game through launcher.exe

## disclaimer

**i do not (and will never) support cheating through the usage of these scripts or any other means.**
**these scripts are not to be used on official multiplayer servers, and i will not provide any support for those who choose to do that.**

scripts are very experimental and W.I.P, please let me know of any issues
